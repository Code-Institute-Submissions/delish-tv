## Summary
Delish TV is a Netflix companion site that enables users to find the various restaurants featured in their favourite Netflix Original culinary shows. 

## Aim of the site
Food television is the fastest-growing niche in unscripted TV, according to [a recent study by The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/gordon-ramsay-more-hollywoods-growing-hunger-food-tv-shows-1225214). After dipping its toe into the waters in 2015 with the release of Chef's Table, Netflix became one of the leaders in investing in original culinary programming. Today, Netflix's catalogue of culinary shows includes The Chef Show, starring Hollywood superstar Jon Favreau; the humble street stands of Street Food Asia; Michelin star chefs in Chef's Table and Chef's Table France; and a smorgasbord of cuisines and settings in Ugly Delicious, starring celeb chef David Chang. 

Brandon Riegg, Netflix VP of nonfiction series and comedy specials, said that food and cooking shows are the frontrunners when looking at categories of programming that people respond to globally. Lisa Nishimura, Netflix VP independent film and documentary features, said that people connect with these shows because "even though you can't smell or taste this food through the screen, you can absolutely feel it."

While shows such as Ugly Delicious and Street Food can give us a sense of what it is like to visit a particular business and we can witness our hosts delighting at the food on offer, it can be challenging to find more information about the various settings that they explore. If a viewer wishes to find more information, they must become proficient with Google and be very willing to peruse article after article that may provide them with some tidbits of information.

The purpose of this site is to connect users with the restaurants and businesses featured in Netflix Original culinary shows and provide them with relevant information should they wish to experience it for themselves rather than live through an on-screen host. The link between restaurant and Netflix show adds another dimension when a user is looking for a restaurant as they will be able to judge a restaurant on more than the menu, still pictures, and reviews from users who they do not know; instead, they can see the food preparation and presentation brought to life as well as reactions to a dish. 

## Scope 
The site targets not only viewers of Netflix Original culinary shows, but is of use to foodies living in an area in which a series have taken place as well as travellers. As a business, we have our own distinct goals, as reflected by the user stories.

### User Stories
"As a viewer of culinary shows, I am often automatically recommended other reality TV shows that have nothing to do with food. I would like to find similarly themed series that would be of interest to me."

"As a fan of Ugly Delicious, I would like to find out more information about some of my favourite restaurants featured in the series."

"As someone travelling to Japan, I would like an easy way to find out more about the Toyo street food restaurant, as seen on Street Food Asia, so that I can experience the food and performance for myself." 

"As a foodie, I would like to thoroughly research restaurants in my area to ensure that it appeals to me and that I will get value for money." 

#### Meeting User Expectations

### Business Goals
"As a business, we would like to showcase our range of culinary series, as we would like users to keep finding value for money in their subscription or attract new customers."

"As a business, we would like to highlight the restaurants involved in series, which rewards them for allowing a series to be filmed there."

"As a business, we wish to continue making original culinary series and providing this added value to participating restaurants could encourage others to get involved."
